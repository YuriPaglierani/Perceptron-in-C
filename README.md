# The programs
I've loaded 2 programs: MyPercep is the learning algorithm that saves on a file the weight vector, while Output Produced reads the weight vector (from the previous file) and an input from the user producing a scalar output between -1 (false) and 1 (true).
This is only an example but it can be useful to understand some easy applications and (most importantly) the limits of Perceptron (es the XOR problem)
